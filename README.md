# A mini-project about house price prediction using machine learning (Random Forest Regressor), and TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) function. The ML model reached ~90% accuracy and the difference between predicted/estimated price and actual price is at ~4%
# I made this project in line with my interest in real estate, so I used local (Philippines) house price data that was web-scraped from lamudi.ph, a local real estate listing site.
