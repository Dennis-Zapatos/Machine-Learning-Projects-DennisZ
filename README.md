# A mini-project about house price prediction using machine learning (Random Forest Regressor), and TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) function.
# I made this project in line with my interest in real estate, so I used local (Philippines) house price data that was web-scraped from lamudi.ph, a local real estate listing site.
# Data Source: https://www.lamudi.com.ph/
